It will generate a JSON file. Execute the JSON file and it will synchronously take a user through a decision tree so that he may come to a decision on his problem. The developer could also get the JSON file as an object.\r\n\r\nExample Output\r\n=======\r\nSandwichAI.java example:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nDo you have peanut butter, jelly and bread?\r\n1. NO\r\n2.
